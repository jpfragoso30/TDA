Hiya all!

Welcome to your second coding challenge of this module. 

The projectÂ´s task is to implement a binaryBuffer module source code using coding
good practices - SOLID principles- and guiding yourself from the interfaces defined 
in the header file binaryBuffer.h within the libs folder. 

Once the final implementation of the binaryBuffer is finished. Try compiling it using 
CMAKE by going to the build directory and running:

> cmake ..
> make

And there should not be any problems for it to compile. 

If it does compile, try to pass the test bench by going to the ../test folder and
by compiling your project from the ./test/build directory. To run the tests use the 
same syntaxis as above.


> cmake ..
> make

If everything goes well - you should be able to run the tests running! 

In case of any doubts - contact the module leader at:

Good luck and have fun!
